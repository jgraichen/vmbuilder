ubuntu-jeos-builder (0.1a-0ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  [ Soren Hansen ]
  * Initial release.

  [ Neal McBurnett ]
  * DESTINATION is now a directory, not a zip file.  This is faster, and
    fixes problems with zipping files bigger than 2 GB.  Involves
    chowning files to $SUDO_USER.
  * Change default archive to http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu from se....
  * Check that we're running as root before making $WORKINGDIR
  * Add support for --vm qemu and create launchjeos command for it
  * Add Build-Depends debhelper
