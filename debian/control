Description: Ubuntu VM builder
 This is the Ubuntu VM builder script which automates the process of creating
 a ready to use VM based on Ubuntu. You can pass command line options to add
 extra packages, remove packages, choose which version of Ubuntu, which mirror
 etc. On recent hardware with plenty of RAM, tmpdir in /dev/shm or using a tmpfs, 
 and a local mirror, you can bootstrap a vm in less than a minute.
