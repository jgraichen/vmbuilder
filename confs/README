Do not modify files in this directory, they will be replaced each
time ubuntu-vm-builder is updated.

To change the default configuration for ubuntu-vm-builder, you can 
use :
 * /etc/ubuntu-vm-builder for the system wide configuration
 * ~/.ubuntu-vm-builder for a user specific configuration

The configurations will be read in the order above, so user specific
configurations will supersede system wide configuration.

You can replace the user specific configuration with an execution
time configuration using the -c parameter.
